#Quizchallenge
This project was designed as a homework assignment for Trilogy Education coding bootcamp.

This is a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This application emphasizes the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions and collect user data to determine whether the answers to a question are correct, 
this then generates a score and appends a final page of results from the user data.

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link.
